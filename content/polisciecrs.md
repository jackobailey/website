I run a Slack channel for PhD students and early career researchers in political science. We welcome anyone who studies anything related to democracy, elections, voting, and public policy.

If that sounds like you and you would like to join the community, [click here](https://join.slack.com/t/polisciecrs/shared_invite/zt-hkf1gxw2-NXZiFO9dwyz9Gyn84gh3Jw).
