I am a Research Associate on the [British Election Study](https://www.britishelectionstudy.com), based at [the University of Manchester](https://www.socialsciences.manchester.ac.uk/politics/).

I research [economic voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Economic_voting) and sexual minority voting behaviour. I am also interested in polling and statistics.
